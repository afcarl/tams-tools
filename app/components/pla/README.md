PLA component
=============

This component renders PLA (progammable logic array) data as interactive SVG canvas.

It also does some cost calculations based on the PLA data.

## Terminology

 * throughout the code the words "loop" and "loops" are used in relation to gates that correspond to the loops drawn in a Karnaugh map.
